i think its time i call it quits on [flashcarrd](https://fc.benadryl.dev). it was a fun project though.

i thought [quizlet](https://quizlet.com) was pretty bad, and that i could do better.
since then i have realized that its quite the undertaking, and is not the easiest thing todo.

### the problems

having to setup the auth, database, and ui is so much work.
its possible, but then trying to make each part good is not.
you know the saying about full stack devs:
_"jack of all trades, master of none."_

the project got very messy, very quick. i refuse to spend another minute in that codebase.
i thought it would be interesting to try and be more "object oriented" in my design, which was a very bad decision.
you should watch ["object-oriented programming is bad"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM) by brian will.
it's a great example of why its the wrong choice in some cases.
if you want proof for yourself, just checkout [the github repo](https://github.com/brodyking/ptrack).
no words are needed. head into `api/` and you will not be disappointed.

### what i learned

i made auth more secure(ish) by using cookies, which i plan to add to [pouchtrack](https://pt.benadryl.dev).
i have almost no free time right now so it will be awhile before thats done.

anyways have a good day
