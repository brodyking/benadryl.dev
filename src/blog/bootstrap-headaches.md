i just released version 5 of [pouchtrack](https://pt.benadryl.dev), which concluded most of the features i wanted to add to the app. the next step is styling.

i have been using bootstrap because it was fast and easy to add to my projects, but it has come at a cost.

### no customization

trying to make a bootstrap website look like anything but bootstrap is near impossible.
i wouldnt mind if it looked modern, but bootstrap is stuck in this 2015 era design and its starting to show.
this website is made with bootstrap, and it works great. 
its a simple blog, with buttons and text. this is the perfect use case for it.
but for large scale projects, it is pretty bad.

### plans

im going to try and navigate away from it. either with another library or raw css by me. 

anyways have a nice day!
